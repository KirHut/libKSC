/*!
 * Extremely Simple QObject that just emits a signal when it is activated.
 *
 * It seems like an odd missing feature in Qt that there is no object that literally just emits a signal when you want
 * it to. The signals and slots mechanism is very powerful, and allows for thread-safe event-based object communication,
 * but for some reason there is no QObject that literally just emits a signal when you want it to emit a signal. There
 * are many use cases where you want to emit a signal from an object that is not a QObject, and that object not being a
 * QObject is usually a deliberate engineering choice. To facilitate signal emission from these objects, this extremely
 * simple class exists.
 *
 * All it does is emit the activated() signal when the activate() method is called. The activate() method is a slot
 * itself in case this is necessary, though if you have an object that can emit a signal already you probably have no
 * need for a SignalEmitter. The activate() method may nonetheless be called by non QObject classes. An additional
 * intActivate() method and intActivated() signal are included to allow communication of values.
 *
 * Threading is handled entirely by the Qt signals and slots mechanism, no effort was made to make this class thread
 * safe in any way!
